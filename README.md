# Aharos v1.0

My lib to handle most commons topics of game programming using SFML & Thor

If you wanna learn, I recommand you to see the Example folder


------------------------------------------

In the StateCreator folder, you will find the sources of a software to easily create a State machine and generate all files you will need

------------------------------------------

In thr StateFileGenerator, you will find the source of a simple software to generate a single State (you'd better use StateCreator, because I will not keep StateFileGenerator up to date)
